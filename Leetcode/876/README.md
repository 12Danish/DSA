# Middle of the Linked List

### URL:
[Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/description/)

## Intuition
The problem requires finding the middle node of a given singly linked list. If there are two middle nodes, we must return the second one. The approach involves first determining the length of the linked list and then finding the middle node based on this length.

## Approach
1. **Determine the Length of the Linked List**:
   - Traverse the linked list to count the total number of nodes (`ll_len`).

2. **Calculate the Middle Position**:
   - If the length is odd: `ceil(ll_len / 2)`.
   - If the length is even: `(ll_len / 2) + 1`.
   - This ensures that if there are two middle nodes, we return the second one.

3. **Traverse to the Middle Node**:
   - Start from the head and move forward until reaching the calculated middle position.

4. **Return the Middle Node**.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:  
  - First pass to find length: $$O(n)$$  
  - Second pass to reach the middle: $$O(n)$$  
  - Overall: $$O(n)$$

- **Space Complexity**:  
  - Uses only a few variables: $$O(1)$$
