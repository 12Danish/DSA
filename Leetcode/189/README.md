# Rotate Array

### URL:
[Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)

## General Idea:

The problem requires rotating an array `nums` to the right by `k` steps. Rotating means shifting the elements in the array to the right, and wrapping the elements that fall off to the beginning of the array. The goal is to achieve this in-place, modifying the original array without using extra space for another array.

## Approach 1: Reverse Segments

This approach involves reversing parts of the array in three main steps:

1. Reverse the entire array.
2. Reverse the first `k` elements.
3. Reverse the remaining `n - k` elements.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity is as follows: $$O(N)$$

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is as follows: $$O(1)$$ since no extra space is used.

## Approach 2: Python Slicing

This approach uses Pythonâ€™s powerful slicing feature to rotate the array in a single line of code:

1. Slice the last `k` elements and bring them to the front.
2. Append the remaining elements.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity is as follows: $$O(N)$$

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is as follows: $$O(1)$$ since it modifies the array in place.
