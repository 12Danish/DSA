## General Idea:

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by recursively dividing the array into halves until each subarray has only one element. Then, it merges the subarrays in a sorted manner to produce the sorted array. The key steps are:

- Divide: Split the array into two halves.
- Conquer: Recursively sort each half.
- Merge: Combine the sorted halves to form a sorted array.

## Time Complexity:

The time complexity is as follows: \O(N \log_2 N\)

## Space Complexity:

The space complexity is as follows: $$O(N)$$ due to the temporary arrays used for merging.
